Notes 

useTTS.ts (Text-to-Speech Hook) 

What it does: Converts text into spoken audio using the browser's built-in speech synthesis. 

 

Core components: 

speak(text, options) - Main function that makes text speak 

Uses SpeechSynthesisUtterance (browser API) to create a speech object 

Options: rate (speed), pitch (voice tone), volume 

isSpeaking - Boolean state that tracks if speech is active  

Updates when speech starts/stops 

Used to change button states (Play/Stop) 

voices - Array of available voices on the system  

Loads asynchronously when component mounts 

Different browsers have different voices 

Event handlers:  

onstart → Sets isSpeaking = true 

onend → Sets isSpeaking = false 

onerror → Handles errors and logs them 

 

How it works step-by-step: 

User clicks "Read Alerts" button 

Button calls speak("Alert message") 

Hook creates SpeechSynthesisUtterance object with the text 

Browser's speech engine speaks the text 

When done, onend fires and updates stat 

 

useVoiceCommands.ts (Voice Recognition Hook) 

What it does: Listens to your voice and matches what you say to predefined commands. 

 

Core components: 

Speech Recognition API - Browser's voice recognition  

webkitSpeechRecognition (Chrome/Edge) 

Converts speech → text (transcript) 

transcript - The final text of what you said  

Used to match against commands 

interimTranscript - Text as you're speaking (real-time)  

Shows what the browser thinks you're saying 

Command matching:  

Converts your speech to lowercase text 

Checks if transcript includes any command strings 

Supports regex for flexible matching (e.g., "search for X") 

 

How it works step-by-step: 

User clicks "Voice Commands" button 

startListening() is called 

Browser asks for microphone permission 

User says "read my alerts" 

Speech → transcript: "read my alerts" 

Hook finds matching command 

Executes the command's action() function
